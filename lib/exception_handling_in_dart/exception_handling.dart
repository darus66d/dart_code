/*Exception Handling in Dart
Exception vs Error:
- Exception: An exceptional event that occurs during program execution
  * Can be caught and handled
  * Usually indicates a recoverable problem
  * Examples: FileNotFoundException, FormatException

- Error: A serious problem that should not be caught
  * Indicates a programming error
  * Usually cannot be recovered from
  * Examples: OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError

Best Practices:
1. Only catch exceptions you can handle
2. Be specific with exception types
3. Don't catch errors
4. Clean up resources in finally blocks
5. Use custom exceptions for domain-specific errors
